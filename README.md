## v1.5.6 (2025-09-24)  
**Mention Logic Update**

### âœ… Whatâ€™s new
- `/warn`, `/warnings`, and `/pardon` now **ping the user** with `<@userId>` so members receive a notification.  
- `/ban` and `/banlist` use **username + ID only** (no ping), avoiding unnecessary notifications for banned users.  

### ðŸ”„ Improvements
- Logs are now clearer and more consistent with mentions vs tags.  
- Admin actions are still fully visible to everyone in the log channel.  

---

## v1.5.5 (2025-09-24)  
**Public Replies (No More Ephemeral Responses)**  

- Removed all `ephemeral: true` flags.  
- All command replies (success, errors, help, logs) are now **posted in the channel for everyone to see**.  
- Permission errors, user feedback, and command outputs are no longer private.  

---

## v1.5.4 (2025-09-24)  
**Command Visibility Update**  

- All slash commands are now visible to everyone in the guild.  
- Admin-only commands (`/ban`, `/warn`, `/pardon`, `/clearwarns`) enforce permissions **at runtime** instead of being hidden.

## v1.5.2 (2025-09-23)  
**Stability & Quality Polishing**  

- Improved ban sync reliability on startup and re-invite.  
- `/banlist`, `/warnings`, `/pardon` now provide clearer feedback if user not found or not banned.  
- Logs improved to use `<@user>` mentions instead of plain tags.  
- Fixed slash commands not appearing reliably after deploy by enforcing per-guild registration.  
- Clearer error messages when bot lacks permissions.  

---

## v1.5.1 (2025-09-23)  
**Ban Sync & Guild Support**  

- Added ban sync on startup â€” lifetime ban list always matches the serverâ€™s bans.  
- Listens to `guildBanAdd` and `guildBanRemove` to keep ban cache updated.  
- Added `guildCreate` handler â†’ registers slash commands & syncs bans when bot joins a new server.  

---

## v1.5.0 (2025-09-23)  
**Slash Command Migration + Ban Sync**  

- Migrated all commands from `!prefix` to Discord slash commands:  
  - `/bb` â†’ Help & command list  
  - `/warn @user [reason]` â†’ Warn member (3 warnings = auto-ban)  
  - `/warnings [@user]` â†’ Check warnings  
  - `/clearwarns @user [reason]` â†’ Reset warnings  
  - `/ban @user [reason]` â†’ Manual ban  
  - `/pardon @user [reason]` â†’ Pardon/unban
