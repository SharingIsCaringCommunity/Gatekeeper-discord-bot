## v1.6.1 (2025-09-24)  
**Pardon Fix & Lifetime Ban Updates**

### âœ… Whatâ€™s new
- `/pardon` now supports **User IDs directly**:
  - Works even if the user is lifetime-banned and not in the server anymore.
  - Automatically resets their warnings to 0 and removes them from the lifetime ban cache.
- Logs and replies show pardons correctly, even for users not in the guild.

### ðŸ”„ Improvements
- Auto-ban at 3 warnings is now always treated as a **lifetime ban**.
- DM embeds for bans now show **who banned the user**.
- Log channel updated with clearer ban/pardon messages.

### ðŸ›  Fixes
- Fixed bug where `/pardon` failed on lifetime-banned users due to missing `User` object.
