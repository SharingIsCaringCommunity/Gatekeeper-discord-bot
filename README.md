  - `/warn @user [reason]` â†’ Warn member (3 warnings = auto-ban)  
  - `/warnings [@user]` â†’ Check warnings  
  - `/clearwarns @user [reason]` â†’ Reset warnings  
  - `/ban @user [reason]` â†’ Manual ban  
  - `/pardon @user [reason]` â†’ Pardon/unban  
  - `/banlist` â†’ Show all lifetime-banned members  
- Commands are registered per-guild (`GUILD_ID` required).  
- Better UX: autocompletion, no need to remember prefixes.
